  const theoNinaPassage="Theo sat alone on the bench by the fence, at the far edge of the school garden. He had a shoebox full of tiny gears, wires, and bottle caps, and he was carefully building a little robot out of the pieces. Across the field, the other kids were laughing and racing each other in a game of kickball. Theo watched the ball fly past, wishing he could feel that easy and loud, but his hands stayed still on his robot, and he felt like he was watching everything through a window.\n\nA girl named Nina wandered over from the kickball game. Nina was quick and a little clumsy, and she had grass stains on both knees from sliding into home plate.\n\n\"Whoa,\" she said, crouching down. \"Is that a robot? Are you going to play kickball with us?\"\n\nTheo shook his head. \"I like building things. I'm not very good at kicking.\"\n\n\"That's fine,\" Nina said, shrugging. \"I'm not very good at building. Everything I make falls apart. But it's still fun to try.\"\n\nShe pointed back at the field. \"We actually need one more player for second base. Come on — I'll stand next to you the whole time.\"\n\nTheo paused. He looked down at his half-finished robot, then up at Nina's eager, dirt-smudged grin. He set the shoebox on the bench. \"Okay,\" he said quietly.\n\nNina cheered and pulled him up by the sleeve. They jogged together to second base. Theo missed the first ball that came his way, but he didn't care much. When the game ended, they walked back to the bench together.\n\n\"You're really quick, Nina,\" Theo said, catching his breath.\n\n\"And you're really clever, Theo,\" she replied. \"Maybe you can build me a tiny robot of my own sometime. And I can teach you how to catch a pop fly.\"\n\nThey both smiled. Theo knew that he liked quiet, careful things, and Nina liked fast, loud things — but he also knew that didn't matter nearly as much as he'd thought. What mattered was that Nina had noticed him, and had made him feel like he belonged. From that afternoon on, Theo and Nina ate lunch together almost every day, trading half a sandwich for a spare gear whenever they could.";
