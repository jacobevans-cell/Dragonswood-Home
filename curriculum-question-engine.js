   WHY THIS EXISTS
   The lesson map's skill names came out of PDF extraction with stray spaces
   inside words ("T H Ree -Digit B Y O Ne -Digit M Ultiplication"). The old
   generators chose which question to build by substring-testing that text
   (skill.includes("multip")), so a mangled label silently fell through to a
   generic branch and taught the WRONG SKILL without any error.
   This engine dispatches on a stable skillId instead. Display text can never
   again change what is taught.
   ========================================================================== */

   buildUniqueQuestionPlan can actually surface a different question */

   SENTENCE FACTORY

   (complete subject, simple subject, predicate, prepositional phrase, object
